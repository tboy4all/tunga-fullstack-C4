            <h1>Debugging isn't scary</h1>
            <p>
              When writing code of some kind, everything is usually fine, until
              that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done something
              wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite
              how you wanted it to. For example, the following shows an error
              reported when trying to compile a simple program written in the
              Rust language.

                Here, the error message is relatively easy to understand —
                "unterminated double quote string". If you look at the listing,
                you can probably see how println!(Hello, world!"); might
                logically be missing a double quote. However, error messages can
                quickly get more complicated and less easy to interpret as
                programs get bigger, and even simple cases can look a little
                intimidating to someone who doesn't know anything about Rust.
                Debugging doesn't have to be scary though — the key to being
                comfortable with writing and debugging any programming language
                or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools.
